# tictactoe3D
-This shares many similarities with the 2D-v2 code (ie. AI uses minimax algorithm to make decisions.)<br/>
-Differences include the use of SVG for the graphics drawing, "pruning" of the minmax tree, and touch swipe functionality for the mobile device.<br/>
-Used a more efficient checkWin() function saving an order of magnitude in AI decision time.<br/>
-Used alpha-beta pruning on minmax tree, allowing AI to shift depth cutoff from 1 to 4 and equal decision time.<br/>
-JSDocs are also available for this game. See: www.JSDocsPageGoesHere.com
